ZBarDemo
========

A simple iPhone app utilizing the [ZBar iPhone SDK][1] to perform bar code scanning.

Setup
=====
This repository depends on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to download the ZBarSDK.  If you haven't used CocoaPods before, I wrote a [simple guide](http://www.overacker.me/blog/2013/07/29/managing-project-dependencies-in-xcode-an-introduction-to-cocoapods/) to get you started.  Once you have CocoaPods, open Terminal and run the following commands:

    $ pod install
    $ open ZBarDemo.xcworkspace
